            When browsing the web, it is often observed that the upcoming resultpages do not show satisfying results, are not userfriendly or even annoying to use.<br>
            Why does this happen?

            Website providers profit from a large number of visitors on their page, for example because they want to sell their product on the site.<br>
            In order to have a lot of people visiting their site, it is really important that their website appears in the first few result pages.<br>
            That is where SEO comes into play. The term SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. The goal of SEO is to transform a website in such way, that it is ranked highly by Google's algorithm. SEO takes advantage of how these algorithms work.<br>
            Website providers use SEO to push thier sites and make them appear higher in the search results.<br>
            What does it have to do with unsatisfying Google results?<br>
            This way, a user cannot say, whether a page is highly ranked because of it's quality or because of SEO.
            A short explanation what SEO is and how it contributes to bad search engine result pages

            Our goal is to know how much SEO is currently done in the web and we want to be able to make an assumption/statement about a page, whether and how much SEO was done on it.<br>
            <br>
            So we are interested in finding a measurement for SEO.<br>
            In order to achieve that, we are, on one hand, conducting research on SEO tools. We want to know what they do and how they work to then be able to use that knowledge when analysing a webpage.<br>
            On the other hand we are analysing the form, look and characteristics of web pages in connection with their rank, so the position in which they appear after entering a searchquery.<br>
            <br>
            Over a long period of time, the web was regularly browsed with a large number of different search queries. For every search query the first 20 webpages that appeared were saved, with the date and their rank.<br>
            This data is the basis for our analysis.<br>
            In our case we are working with a selection of 100 out of all original search queries and a selection of three moments in time.
            You can see the exact list of queries down below.<br>
            From the raw data we then extracted the information about different characteristics of the web pages.<br>
            We then, as a final step, are comparing the different characteristics in corralation to their rank and over the three different moments in time.
